## Break, Print, Fix, Repeat

There has been increasing concern recently (rightly so) over the use of plastic in modern society. From microbeads in cosmetic items to the huge amount of single use plastic that end up in the sea.

Perhaps it would make sense to view the boom in consumer 3D printing as another addition to this colossal problem, feeding the casual manufacture and disposal of this damaging material. But could 3D printing be part of the solution?

We've already seen in our other blog post about the biodegradable benefits of PLA, however this does not absolve society from aiming to only use materials when necessary. So how could 3D printing reduce plastic waste?

In early 2018 MyMiniFactory (a curated social platform for 3D printable objects) launched a competition to encourage it users to create and share their examples of spare parts created for domestic appliances.

The submissions included everything from switches, dials and buttons, to luggage bag wheels. They received so many entries they had to increase the scope and include two '1st place' prizes.

This example shows part of the answer to our plastic problem. If households can reproduce spare parts for their otherwise discontinued products (at a fraction of the cost of buying that part individually) they can increase the lifespan of the product significantly. Forget the days of throwing away a perfectly functional fridge because of a single broken dial or clip.

These spare parts can then be shared around the world and printed. With new parts being uploaded onto MyMiniFactory.com everyday, we can hope to reverse the damaging 'throw-away society' mentality.

## Reduce that Carbon Footprint

There are other benefits of producing products you require at home. Say you want a new vase. Traditionally you might go to a garden centre, *if* you see a vase you like might buy it. That vase may have been locally, but more often than not, it has travelled thousands of miles to sit on that shelf.

Alternatively, you could shop online, and have that vase delivered to your door. Either way, the carbon footprint of that object is astronomical in transport alone. If we look at most of our home furnishings the same can be said for most of them.

Using the magic of consumer additive manufacture we can reduce this problem. We can pick the vase we like from an ever growing variety online, download it to our printer and print it to our exact specifications. No travel (apart from the filament we use to make it, of course).

As with any technology that's new to us, we need to use it responsibly and consider it's implications to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. However, if we think carefully, we can flex the muscles of consumer level 3D printing and reduce our plastic waste.
