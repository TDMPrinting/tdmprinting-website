PLA, or Polylactic acid is a biodegradable and bioactive thermoplastic aliphatic polyester, derived from renewable resources, typically corn starch or sugarcane. This characteristic makes it an attractive material for environmentally friendly applications. &nbsp;For example, a PLA bottle in open ocean would typically degrade in six to 24 months. A conventional plastic in the same environment can take several hundred to a thousand years to degrade.

As a result there is a high potential for PLA to be very desirable for short lifespan applications where biodegradability is sought, such as one of prototype parts. Of note, despite its ability to degrade when exposed to the elements over a long time, PLA is extremely robust in any normal application (e.g. as a plastic electronics part).
