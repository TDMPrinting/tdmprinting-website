PLA, or Polylactic acid is a biodegradable and bioactive thermoplastic aliphatic polyester, derived from renewable resources, typically corn starch or sugarcane. This characteristic makes it an attractive material for environmentally friendly applications. &nbsp;For example, a PLA bottle in open ocean would typically degrade in six to 24 months. A conventional plastic in the same environment can take several hundred to a thousand years to degrade.

As a result there is a high potential for PLA to be very desirable for short lifespan applications where biodegradability is sought, such as one off prototype parts or low volume production items.&nbsp; Despite its ability to biodegrade when exposed to the elements, PLA can be very robust in the vast majority of 3D printed cases.

## The ABS challenger

ABS has been the plastic of choice for engineering applications due to its impressive mechanical and thermal properties with the trade-off being notoriously difficult to print and toxic when printed.

Avoid the ABS bugbears while maintaining impressive mechanical properties with the newest generation of PLA filaments. Polymakers™ PC-Max™ filament boasts:

> "Excellent Mechanical Strength : Parts made with Polymaker PC-Max™ shows much improved mechanical strength compared to ABS and PLA under almost any deformation test.

> Extreme Toughness : Polymaker PC-Max™ offers the absolute best in toughness that is simply unobtainable from other 3D printing materials of similar stiffness. This makes Polymaker PC-Max™ an excellent choice for real-world, engineering applications.

> Heat Resistance: Polymaker PC-Max™ offers better heat resistance than almost all other 3D printing materials currently in the market. It can withstand temperatures well above 110 &ordm;C.
