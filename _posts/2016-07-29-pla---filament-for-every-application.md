PLA, or Polylactic acid is a biodegradable and ‘bioactive thermoplastic aliphatic polyester', obtained from renewable resources such as corn starch or sugarcane. This makes it an attractive material for environmentally friendly 3D printing. For example, a PLA bottle in open ocean could degrade in six to 24 months. A conventional plastic in the same environment can take several hundred to a thousand years to degrade. (It is worth noting however that the degradation time in landfill is comparable with other plastics.)

As a result there is a high potential for PLA to be very desirable for many applications where biodegradability is advantageous when considering the total product lifespan, such as one off prototype parts or low volume production items.&nbsp; Despite its ability to biodegrade natually, PLA can be very robust in the vast majority of 3D printed cases.

## The ABS challenger

ABS has been the plastic of choice for engineering applications due to its impressive mechanical and thermal properties, with the trade-off being notoriously difficult to print and toxic.

Avoid the ABS bugbears while maintaining impressive mechanical properties with the newest generation of PLA filaments. Polymakers™ PolyMax™ PLA filament boasts:

> Extremely Tough : Regular PLA is a very brittle material, which greatly limits its range of applications. PolyMax™ PLA was designed to change this. Featuring increased impact strength of up to 9 times that of regular PLA and 20% better than ABS, PolyMax™ PLA is a sure winner when it comes to toughness. So if you are looking for a material that can withstand your mechanically demanding tasks, PolyMax™ PLA is up to the challenge.

> Uncompromised Quality : The good mechanical strength of PolyMax™ PLA is achieved with no compromise in printing quality. As PolyMax™ PLA is also produced with Jam-Free™ technology you can be certain you will get high quality prints with excellent strength while still enjoying the ease of printing PLA.

> ABS? No More : Still printing ABS while trying to endure the odour and potential health risk? With PolyMax™ PLA you can get rid of that potentially hazardous ABS and still achieve the same structural strength with even more benefits such better printer compatibility, easier printing, less warping, no hazardous odours, and in many cases even better mechanical properties.

Although PLA cannot match the thermal properties of ABS due to a lower glass transition temperature, mechanical properties can be matched with the much more user-friendly PLA.

## PLA&nbsp;*is&nbsp;*Flexible

Ok, while it’s not *strictly&nbsp;*PLA, it is a similar natural based biopolymer, so like PLA it’ll naturally degrade. It’s also easy to print and gives consistent results.

Flexible 3D prints open yet another door of possibilities, from flexible joints and bushes, to applications requiring a softer grip, such as robotic arms or tyres.![](/uploads/versions/flex-image-opt---x----481-322x---.jpg)

Customers can pick the type of filament based on its Shore Hardness level, so specific requirements can be catered for.

## Find your finish

When it comes to 3D printing, it’s all about the filament, and with PLA variations increasing in popularity, there’s something for everyone.

With new filaments appearing on the market every week there are no shortages of design choices. From premium quality PLA to bright, transparent grades, or metallic effect grades, it’s just a case of picking your style.
