For this project the client wanted a crest 3D printed for use as a key-ring fob. The original image served as a reference for the 3D model, which was then created in Inventor.

The process began with the basic shape which would go on to form the base or back of the model. From there the individual shapes were created. These shapes are independent from each other, so specific properties can be assigned to enhance the aesthetic of the model. Here we can see the circular base.

He we can see the individual properties of each shape at work, allowing an attractive looking form to be achieved on certain parts of the model. Creating the model from scratch allows a level of interpretation of the 2D image, and how that might translate into a 3D shape.

The finished product is created with extra details added, such as radii on the rope loops and buckle. The choice of font had to be changed from the original model. Times New Roman, the most closely resembling font to the original image was not suitable as there are thin parts on the text that cannot be printed with accuracy when scaled down. Tahoma was used instead as the text is more chunky with equal width around the letters. A tag is added at the top of the model so it can be held on a key ring.

The model was then printed in high strength PLA.
