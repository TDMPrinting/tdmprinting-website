For a highly anticipated game I was tasked with recreating a piece of the games 2D Art.

The original image was imported into Autodesk Inventor, from the there model was built around the image, so the proportions were correct. Without any previous 3D interpretations of this design, I made a version of the design based on the context.

Some aspects of the design had to be modified to be suitable to print. For example the groove that defines the face of the monkey had to be modified at the chin area, otherwise the wall thickness would be too small for a clean print.

Where possible models are designed so that they do not require supporting structures in the printing process. Not only does this save time and material, but helps to maintain a consistent finish across the part.

The part shown is pictured without any post-processing, from here the part can be smoothed, painted or sprayed for additional visual changes.
