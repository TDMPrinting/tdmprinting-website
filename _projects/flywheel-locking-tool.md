This project shows the powerful benefits of rapid prototyping, as the component went from initial drawing to finished component in an afternoon.

From this initial drawing, the customer created a model of their desired component in CAD software. This was then sent to print, within 2 hours of being a concept on paper, a solid component was being printed.

The component is used to lock a clutch flywheel to make its removal easier. Such a device is not available for purchase, the process for removal would be difficult and time consuming without.

With 3D Printing a bespoke component can be made very rapidly, drastically reducing downtime.
