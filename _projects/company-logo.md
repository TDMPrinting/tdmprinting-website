This project encompasses the variety of company, game and personal logos we have created for customers.

Using premium 'Diamond Black' filament from ColorFabb, the customer required a logo for their game. The logo was recreated in 3D form, incorporating the eroded and worn down aesthetic of the original 2D image.

This print can stand freely on a desk, then taken to game shows to promote the game. The quality and aesthetic of this object makes it seem less like a 3D printed part and more like a piece of original art from the game.

This next print is for a local engineering company. Using bright blue PLA to match with the company's own colour scheme, this logo literally stands out on any desk or shelf. If required a number of finishes can now be applied, for example to create a glossy effect. The image shown is a totally un-post-processed print straight off the printer.

TDM Printing caters to a wide variety of customers with whatever 3D printing requirements they bring with them. The next print is for a popular gaming Youtuber, combining his name and logo into a desk piece.

Again using the premium 'Diamond Black' filament, this object is an attractive object for a desk, or to catch the attention of viewers for promotion.
