Working with a talented character artist, busts of characters from a popular game franchise were recreated.

These show off the high detail capabilities of the Ultimaker 3, using breakaway support material to produce a clean print with zero post processing. However these prints can be post processed to add different styles, such as smoothed to remove the printing lines.

Printable in a variety of materials to suit personal preference, from premium quality black filament, to wood, to transparent. The models are 80mm high, the perfect size for a desk model.
